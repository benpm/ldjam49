# LDJAM 49
Theme: Unstable

## Brainstorm
- Lots of unstable rooms where you have to complete tasks or they explode or something
- You're a goat
- Room with falling tiles
- New rooms appear regularly
- Room with wood to chop
- Score is time that you've lasted
- Complete actions by pressing various keyboard keys in the right order
- Shaking and coloring effect for failing rooms
- Something to indicate that you've hit max fix time
- Tapping tasks should replenish timer as fast as you can tap
- Room with floatation tank: press button to add water to prevent bob from hitting bottom as water slowly leaks.
- 
- Name ideas:
  - Psychogoat Collapse
